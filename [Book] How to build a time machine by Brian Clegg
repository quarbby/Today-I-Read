Herbert George wells: any freak body must have extension in four directions: length, breadth, thickness, dimension

Two absolute essentials of real time travel are linkage of space and time and the influence of gravity on space time continuum. Albert Einstein 

As an object approach the speed of light it shrinks and gets hugely msssive. Time for that object becomes detached from the progress of time in the slow moving world 

Special relativity is dubbed special because it’s a special case Einstein considered only bodies moving steadily that weren’t accelerating 

Relativity of simultaneity: the concepts of two events being simultaneous is modified when the observer is moving. Einstein used two lighting flashes hitting a railway line at the same time but separated spatially. 

GPS system relies on special and general relativity. Special relativity comes into play because satellites are moving with respect to the ground. But according to general relativity, the stronger the gravitational pull, the slower the clock runs. So the clock on the satellite would run faster than it were on the ground.

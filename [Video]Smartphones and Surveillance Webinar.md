Contact Tracing Apps - retracing our steps in an interoperable and decentralized manner

*Decentralisation as a vector for vulnerability*
Falsely reporting incidents w/o fear of repercussions:
- imagine an unscrupulous political operative who wanted to dampen a voting participation in a given district, or a desperate business owner who wanted to stifle competition 
- A foreign intelligence operation could shut down an entire city through the simple expedient of false reporting COVID-19 in every neighbourhood

*Adequate safeguards*
- Limitations on secondary use/ data retention
- Open source
- Prohibit economic and social discrimination
- Voluntary app can be compulsory: display results before entering stores
